# repository.kodi.yatse

This repository contains scripts and plugins to enhance Kodi experience when used from Yatse.

You first need to add the repository to your Kodi then install the addon.

For that download: 

https://github.com/Tolriq/repository.yatse.kodi/raw/master/zips/repository.kodi.yatse.tv/repository.kodi.yatse.tv-1.1.0.zip

Then install it from Kodi

Or follow the full procedure from https://yatse.tv/wiki/yatse-kodi-addon

Some code and inspiration are taken from: https://github.com/Nemiroff/script.yatse2quasar
A part of url resolving uses https://github.com/tvaddonsco/script.module.urlresolver with a modified addon id to avoid clash and be sure that there's no need for other repository that could push unwanted unsafe addons.
